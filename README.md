# actions.publish-npm

Packs and publishes NPM packages to a package registry in a repo that uses nodejs devcontainers.

## Features

- üêã Devcontainer-based builds for environment consistency
- üì¶ Automated NPM packaging/publishing

## Usage Examples

### Minimal example that publishes to GitHub package registry

```yaml
name: Publish Package
on: [push]

permissions:
    packages: write # So github.token can publish npm packages

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: spritely/actions.publish-npm@v0.1.0
        with:
          packageRegistryToken: myToken
          projectDirectory: Projects/MyProject
          version: 1.0.0
          # This is the default, but you can publish to other private registries
          # Just make sure to provide the correct auth information.
          # packageRepository: https://npm.pkg.github.com/your-org/index.json
          # For npm.pkg.github, your personal access token (PAT) or github.token is used as the password.
```

### Building with devcontainer from private GitHub container registry

```yaml
name: Publish from Private Registry
on: [workflow_dispatch]

permissions:
    packages: write

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: spritely/actions.publish-npm@v1
        with:
          packageRegistryToken: myToken
          projectDirectory: Projects/MyProject
          version: 2.1.0-rc.1
          # Read devcontainers from here
          registryHost: ghcr.io
          registryUsername: ${{ github.actor }}
          registryPassword: ${{ github.token }}
```

## Inputs

| Parameter | Description | Required | Default |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `packageRegistryToken` | Package registry auth token | Yes | github.token |
| `projectDirectory` | Path to directory containing your package.json file (relative to root) | Yes | - |
| `version` | Full SemVer 2.0 version string | Yes | - |
| `packageRegistry` | NPM Registry URL | No | GitHub Packages URL |
| `registryHost` | Container registry host for fetching devcontainer | No | - |
| `registryUsername` | Container registry auth username | No | - |
| `registryPassword` | Container registry auth token | No | - |

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit tests (`publish-npm.bats`)

Validate core script logic locally in isolation using a verdaccio container-based npm registry.

### 2. Workflow tests (`workflow-test/`)

Verify full GitHub Action behavior using test container registry and NPM registry. Runs only in GitHub Action pipeline for testing overall workflow.

## DevContainer Decision

This action requires that each repository setup a DevContainer. This is more complex than just having nodejs available on the build server and running the pack and publish commands.

This decision is intentional to steer development to adopt DevContainers across all repositories, establishing a unified development approach and obtaining key DevContainer benefits including:

1. Zero-config onboarding
   - New contributors get working environment with:
     1. git clone
     2. Open project
     3. "Reopen in Container"

2. Consistency
   - Identical build environments for development and build server pipelines
   - Reduces "works on my machine" issues
   - Container-based workflows are more easily portable to alternative platforms like Dagger, GitLab, or Gitea.

3. Dependency management
   - Precise control over build tools, dependencies, and runtime versions without relying on GitHub runner configurations.

4. Multi-OS Support
   - Develop Linux-targeted software from Windows/macOS hosts

While this approach requires explicit DevContainer configuration in each repository, we believe the consistency and reliability benefits outweigh the initial setup cost. Repositories without DevContainers will need to either implement them or develop alternative packaging solutions.
